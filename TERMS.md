# Terms

By using this bot, you allow us to:

1. See command usage and associated information. This includes which command you used, which argument(s) you gave it, and your username.
2. See when these things happen. Timestamps are attached to all logged information.

**Just because we  can, does not mean that we do.** Anything logged is strictly used to further bot development. **Obtained information will not sold to anyone for any reason.**

**I, llamasking\#1513, am the only person who can see the logs and I only ever look at them is when I'm adding new features and debugging.**

The code on the repo is almost the exact same code as is used in the public bot. There may be minor differences since the repo may not recieve updates for several versons.
