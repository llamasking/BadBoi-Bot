# Contributing
If you're here, you wish to contribute to the bot's code. You're more than welcome to fork this bot and if you wish, you can create a pull request to merge the code.

## Ground rules
These rules only apply if you wish to merge your own code in. You're free to do whatever you want with your fork.

    1. The code must be readable. 
        * No code obfuscation, no stupid and pointless variable names, etc.
    2. Your code must work! 
        * Don't give me code that doesn't even run. 
        * The bot is hosted using pm2 for NodeJS. 
    3. Your code must not add an excessive number of dependencies, especially if they have to be downloaded with npm.
    4. Your code has usefull comments and variable names (refer to rule 1) so that everyone knows what is going on.

## Credits
I'll create a !!credits command if anyone ever creates code for this bot. If you wish, you may make it yourself though I am more than willing to do it myself. In any case, feel free to add yourself to the !!credits list.

Please, don't add a stupid number of social medias.
